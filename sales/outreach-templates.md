## LinkedIn Outreach (Cold DM)

### Template 1: The Direct Approach

**Subject:** AI-Powered Executive Portfolio?

**Message:**
```
Hi [First Name],

Noticed you're exploring board/advisory opportunities. Quick question:

When recruiters/board members Google you at midnight (they do), what do they find? LinkedIn? Generic resume?

I built something different: AI-powered executive portfolios that answer recruiter questions 24/7.

Example: [Insert link to Michael Chen demo]

15-min demo? Worth a look if you're serious about standing out.

Best,
[Your Name]

```

**Why it works:**
- Gets to the point fast
- Addresses real pain (late-night recruiter searches)
- Includes proof (demo link)
- Low commitment ask (15 min)

### Template 2: The Value-First Approach

**Subject:** Thought you'd find this interesting

**Message:**
```
[First Name],

Saw your post about [recent topic they posted about]. Spot on about [specific insight].

Here's something you might find interesting: I'm helping C-suite execs stand out in competitive searches using AI.

Think: Your own website + AI assistant that answers recruiter questions instantly.

Example: janesmith-cfo.com (recruiter asks "What's her M&A experience?" at 2am → AI responds with detailed answer)

No pressure—just thought it might be useful given your background. Happy to show you a quick demo if you're curious.

Cheers,
[Your Name]
```

**Why it works:**
- Starts with genuine engagement
- Positions as helpful, not salesy
- Concrete example creates mental image
- "No pressure" reduces resistance

### Template 3: The Referral Approach

**Subject:** [Mutual connection] suggested I reach out

**Message:**
```
Hi [First Name],

[Mutual connection name] mentioned you're exploring [board seats/new role/etc.] and thought you'd appreciate what we're building.

TL;DR: AI-powered executive portfolios that work 24/7.

**The problem:** Recruiters assess you when YOU'RE not available (weekends, late nights). LinkedIn doesn't answer their specific questions.

**Our solution:** Custom website + AI assistant trained on YOUR career. It answers questions like:
- "What's their acquisition experience?"
- "Have they scaled international teams?"
- "What's their cloud transformation background?"

**Example:** [demo link]

15-min call this week? I'll show you exactly how it works for your background.

Best,
[Your Name]

## Email Outreach (Warm Intro)

### Template 1: Executive Coach Referral

**Subject:** Portfolio solution for [Executive Name]

**Email:**
```
Hi [Coach Name],

Hope you're well! Quick idea that might help your clients:

**The situation:** Your exec clients have impressive backgrounds but struggle to stand out in board searches. LinkedIn is table stakes. Generic websites don't tell their story.

**What I built:** AI-powered executive portfolios.

**How it works:**
1. Custom website showcasing their career (think Bloomberg Terminal aesthetic, not Wix)
2. AI assistant that answers recruiter questions 24/7
3. Analytics showing who's viewing, what they're asking

**Example:** [demo link]

**Pricing:** $1,500-2,500/month (less than ONE coaching session, but works 24/7)

Would this be valuable for your clients? Happy to offer a discounted trial for the first 3 execs you refer.

Best,
[Your Name]
```

## Cold Email (To Executives)

### Template: The Problem-Agitate-Solve

**Subject:** You're losing board opportunities at 2am

**Email:**
```
[First Name],

Blunt truth: Board recruiters Google you at weird hours.

2am. Saturday mornings. After dinner.

They have THREE finalists. You're one of them. They want to know:
- "What's her international scaling experience?"
- "Has he led M&A integrations?"
- "What's her thought leadership like?"

**Right now, they find:**
- Your LinkedIn (same as everyone else)
- Maybe some press mentions
- A generic resume PDF

**What if they found:**
- A premium website (yourname.com)
- An AI assistant that answers their exact questions
- Interactive charts showing your revenue impact
- Proof you're tech-forward (you're literally using AI)

**Example:** michaelchen-cto.com [demo link]

**Cost:** $1,500/month. Less than 0.5% of your next comp package.

**ROI:** If this helps you close ONE board seat or negotiate $50k more → 15x return.

15-minute demo? I'll show you exactly what yours would look like.

Best,

Example: [demo link]

Thought it might be relevant given your background. Open to a quick chat if you're curious how it works.

## Script for Phone/Zoom Demo

### Opening (First 2 minutes)

**You:**
"Thanks for taking the time, [Name]. I'll keep this brief—15 minutes, promise.

Quick context: What stage are you at in your search? [Board seats / New C-suite role / Advisory positions]

Great. So here's the problem I'm solving..."

### Problem Statement (2 minutes)

**You:**
"When recruiters evaluate you, they don't do it 9-5 on a Tuesday. They do research at midnight, on weekends, whenever they have time.

They're comparing you to 2-3 other finalists. They have specific questions:
- What's your M&A experience?
- Have you scaled teams internationally?
- What's your cloud transformation background?

Right now, they find your LinkedIn. Maybe Google some old press. That's it.

Make sense?"

### Solution Demo (8 minutes)

**You:**
"So here's what I built. Let me show you an example..."

[Screen share the Michael Chen demo]

"This is what YOUR portfolio would look like.

**First:** Premium website. Dark theme, gold accents. Looks like Bloomberg Terminal, not Wix.

**Second:** Interactive charts. See this revenue growth chart? This is YOUR career impact, visualized.

**Third:** The magic—this chatbot. [Click it]

Watch this. I'm a recruiter at 2am. I ask: 'What's his acquisition experience?'

[Ask the question, show response]

See that? Detailed answer. With numbers. With examples. Instant.

Your AI assistant never sleeps. It  answers every question perfectly. Every time.

**The recruiter gets:**
- Instant answers at 2am
- Sees you're tech-forward (using AI)
- More confident recommending you

**You get:**
- Stand out from other finalists
- Work 24/7 (even while you sleep)
- Analytics on who's viewing, what they ask

Make sense?"

### Pricing & Close (3 minutes)

**You:**
"Pricing is straightforward:

**Standard:** $1,500/month
- Custom website (yourname.com)
- AI assistant
- Monthly updates
- Analytics

**Premium:** $2,500/month
- Everything above
- Monthly thought leadership content
- LinkedIn management
- Newsletter

**Setup:** $500-1,000 one-time.

**Timeline:** Live in 7-10 days.

Questions?"

[Handle objections]

**You:**
"Here's how I think about ROI:

If this helps you negotiate $50k more on your next role → 15x return in year one.

If this helps you close ONE board seat → game over, you win.

For less than 1% of your target comp, you stand out in EVERY search.

Want to move forward?"

---

## Objection Handling

### "That's expensive"

**Response:**
"I hear you. Let me put it in perspective:

- Executive coach: $1,000/session, 10 sessions = $10,000 one-time
- This: $1,500/month, works 24/7/365

If you negotiate $50k more on your next role using this? That's a 15x return.

Plus, you can cancel anytime. No long-term contract."

### "I already have a LinkedIn"

**Response:**
"Totally. LinkedIn is table stakes—everyone has one.

But when a recruiter compares you to 2 other finalists at midnight, they all have great LinkedIns.

This is what makes YOU different:
1. You have your own domain (shows seriousness)
2. You're using AI (shows you're tech-forward)
3. You answer their questions instantly (shows you're accessible)

It's not LinkedIn OR this. It's LinkedIn AND this."

### "I'll think about it"

**Response:**
"Absolutely, take your time.

Two quick questions:
1. Is there anything specific you're unsure about?
2. What's your timeline for your search?

[If they're actively searching]

Here's the thing: Every day you wait, you're losing opportunities. Recruiters are Googling you right now.

What if we did a pilot? First month, if you hate it, I'll refund 100%. Zero risk."

## Pro Tips

1. **Personalize the first line.** Find something specific about them (recent post, company, achievement).

2. **Always include the demo link.** Visual proof  > words.

3. **Ask for 15 minutes, not an hour.** Low commitment = higher yes rate.

4. **Follow up 2-3 times.** Most people are just busy, not uninterested.

5. **Track everything.** Which template converts best? Double down on that.
